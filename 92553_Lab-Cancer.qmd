## Lab Session

### Introduction

Cancer is a rather unique disease in that it can develop in any organ system, spread to other organs, and has several potential causes. It can affect anyone, regardless of age, ethnicity, or sex. Half of all Australian men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their life. The direct health system costs of cancer in Australia is more than \$4.5 billion. The indirect costs, including the psychosocial and emotional stress it can cause is difficult to quantify.

The most common cancers in Australia are prostate, colorectal (bowel), breast, melanoma (skin), and lung cancer, accounting for \>60% of all diagnoses. The main carcinogenic factors are: environment (including behaviour), genetics, oncogenes, hormones, and impaired immune system function. Cancers typically form when one or more of these factors are present.

Most of us have either experienced, or know someone close who has experienced, cancer in their lifetime. Untreated, cancers are typically fatal. But, there are treatments available for many forms of cancer, with many more being developed. Exercise can play a therapeutic role for cancer patients, and there is a growing body of clinical research on the benefits of exercise to counteract the negative effects of cancer and play an important role in its prevention, treatment, and survivorship.

The objectives of this lab are to:

-   Examine the pathophysiology of cancer and its effects on patients' health and well-being

-   Explore the role of exercise in the prevention and treatment of cancer

-   Develop an understanding of exercise prescription considerations in cancer care settings

#### Impacts of Exercise in Cancer Care

The following figure and table from the Hojman et al. (2018) article present an overview of known impacts and effectiveness of exercise in the prevention, treatment, and survivorship of cancer.

#### Exercise Prescription Guidelines

![From Ehrman, J. K., Gordon, P. M., Visich, P. S., & Keteyian, S. J. (Eds.). (2023). Chapter 22. Clinical exercise physiology: Exercise management of chronic diseases and special populations (5th Ed). Human Kinetics.](images/Cancer_ehrmanTbl22_05.png){fig-align="center"}

The above table provides general guidelines for patients undergoing cancer treatment. However, all cancers are unique, so please refer to specific guidelines for the cancer being treated prior to developing exercise programs.

### Activity - Case Studies

In small groups, develop an Exercise Management Plan for each for the following Case Study patients.

#### Case Study 1

Samara is a 47-year old female with breast cancer.

Samara is 10 weeks post surgery (double mastectomy), and is completing her first cycle of chemotherapy. She will then commence radiation therapy and hormone therapy.

Consider the following:

```{=html}
<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col style="width:40%">
    <col style="width:60%">
  </colgroup>
    <thead>
    </thead>
    <tbody style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd">
        <tr>
            <td><b>Objectives/goals of the exercise program for this patient</b></td>
            <td><div contenteditable></div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>General health considerations</b></td>
            <td><div contenteditable></div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Health implications of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy</b></td>
            <td><div contenteditable></div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Breast cancer-specific health considerations</b></td>
            <td><div contenteditable></div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Medical assessments prior to exercise</b></td>
            <td><div contenteditable></div></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

#### Case Study 2

Dev is a 28-year old male with colon cancer.

Dev is 12 weeks post surgery (ostomy), and is undergoing both chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Consider the following:

```{=html}
<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col style="width:40%">
    <col style="width:60%">
  </colgroup>
    <thead>
    </thead>
    <tbody style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd">
        <tr>
            <td><b>Objectives/goals of the exercise program for this patient</b></td>
            <td><div contenteditable></div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>General health considerations</b></td>
            <td><div contenteditable></div></td>
