    "text": "Lab Session\n\nIntroduction\nThere are many different methods to assess strength and functional capacity in individuals with chronic diseases. The gold standard of strength and power assessment is performed on an isokinetic dynamometer. You may have witnessed testing on this device previously (in 92533 Exercise Physiology) or and have seen footage of this testing procedure for different joints of the body. It is possible to determine strength at certain velocities and certain angles which are related to performance in numerous tasks. Further, by looking at rate of force development, exercise scientists can examine power output which is strongly related to exercise performance and risk of falling.\nIn addition to the examination of strength and power, it is important to determine functional capacity. Functional capacity is integrally related to quality of life, and is perhaps a stronger indicator of life satisfaction than specific measures of muscle strength. There are unique tests that can monitor balance, the ability to rise from a chair, walking performance, stair climbing ability and many other facets of daily life. In today’s lab, you will perform some different types of tests that relate to functional performance, and also look at some methods to improve performance in these tests.\n\nAssessment of functional ability in special populations\nFunctional performance is proportionally related to quality of life. There are many ways that exercise scientists can assess functional performance in special populations. One must consider the intensity of the testing and the actions undertaken, however, these types of tests are typically of a lower intensity than traditional tests such as maximal treadmill tests, and therefore safety is less of a concern. Regardless, it is still important to complete the appropriate screening questionnaires and obtain informed consent to participate. Correct technique can be an issue, especially in frail individuals, however, the simple nature of the tests generally permit high levels of reliability and validity.\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nEquipment\n\nCones x 5\nStopwatches x 15\nChairs x 3\nMeasuring tape\n\n\n\nTests\nThe following tests are examples of methods to assess functional capacity and could be used for any sub-population, especially those who are frail, have a chronic disease or a disability.\n\n1.6 km Walk Test\nTo estimate VO2max and investigate self-selected walking speed, a 1.6 km walk test has been shown to be valid and reliable. It is typically conducted around a standard 400 m grass athletic oval. Participants are instructed to cover the distance “walking as fast as comfortably possible.” This test is often selected as exertions of this intensity are ideal for individuals with chronic diseases and older adults. Heart rate is recorded at the completion of the walk, along with time to complete the distance. Average walking speed may be calculated for analytical and comparative purposes. VO2max can be reliably estimated from the 1.6 km walking test, with the following equation shown to yield the least standard error (0.325 L/min; Kline et al., 1987):\n\nVO2max (L/min) = 6.9652 + (0.0091 × body mass) – (0.0257 × age) + (0.5955 × gender[female=0, male=1]) – (0.2240 × time) – (0.0115 × heart rate)\n\nThe reliability of this test has been previously established (r=0.71–0.97) among many age groups.\n\n\nSit-to-Stand Test\nThe sit-to-stand (STS) test measures the time taken to rise from a chair (and sit back down) five times, as fast and as safely as possible (Runge et al., 2000). This test is administered on a chair without arms and a seat height of approximately 40 cm. The chair is fixed to the ground to avoid movement during the test. A standardized position is used for each test that includes being seated in the middle of the chair, back straight, arms folded across the chest, and feet approximately shoulder width apart. A total of three trials are generally performed with 2 min rest between trials with the mean of the best two trials used for analysis. The total time is often measured using pressure pads fixed to the seat, with results recorded and calculated on a computer after each trial. The repeatability of this test is excellent, with interday reliability of the STS test being 0.96. A recent appraisal of the STS test compared to a leg press exercise demonstrated the functionality of the assessment (Alcazar et al., 2018).\n\n\nTimed-Up and Go-Test\nThe timed-up and go-test (TUG) involves standing up from a chair, walking 3 m as quickly and as safely as possible, crossing a line marked on the floor, turning around, and then walking back to sit back down in the chair (Bruyere et al., 2005). The participant is initially seated in a 40 cm-high chair without arms, with his or her back flush against the backrest. The time taken is typically calculated by pressure pads secured to the centre of the seat. Turning time, the time to turn around at the 3-m mark can also be measured if that measure is of interest to the tester. The researcher gives a verbal cue to begin the test, and the times for three trials are recorded, with 2 min rest between trials. The mean of the best two trials is used for analysis. This test also displays excellent interday reliability, with intraclass correlations of the TUG test being 0.90.\n\n\nFast Walk\nThis test requires participants to walk as fast as possible over 10 m. The time taken is calculated using timing gates positioned at 5-m and 10-m intervals from the start line. The starting position involves feet placed together, 30 cm behind the first timing gate. Once ready, participants are allowed to commence the test at their own discretion. It is a requirement of the walking test that one foot be kept in contact with the ground at all times (to prevent running). Three fast-walk trials are usually performed, with a 2 min rest period between trials. The mean of the two best trials is used for analysis. Interday reliabilities of the 5-m and 10-m fast-walk test are 0.95 and 0.98, respectively.\n\n\nStair Mobility Test\nThe stair mobility task involves participants climbing and descending five steps (approximately 20 cm high and 25 cm deep). The test measures the time taken to complete this task twice. Participants are required to ascend and descend one stair at a time and avoid using a handrail. Stair mobility can be assessed by a video camera (recording at 50 Hz) placed 2 m perpendicular to the stairs. In this manner, contact time on each step can be assessed. In today’s lab, you will not be assessing the contact time, rather, you will just assess the total time to complete the task. A total of three trials are generally conducted, with a 2-min rest period between efforts. Interday reliability of the stair mobility task is 0.98.\n\n\nOne-Legged Postural-Steadiness / 3-Dimensional Balance Assessment\nOne legged postural steadiness (OLPS) is assessed during a one-legged stance, analysing the patterns of ground reaction force variability. The starting position involves feet being placed shoulder width apart with weight evenly distributed and eyes facing forward. The subjects are instructed to stand for as long as possible (up to 15 sec) during OLPS, attempting to keep arms by the body for balance. The participants are informed that a touchdown by the non-stance leg is acceptable, yet should be corrected immediately. A touchdown on the force platform contributes to the force variability, which is consistent with using variability of the signal to quantify postural steadiness. Three trials of OLPS are usually completed for both legs. The ground reaction forces are measured on a three-dimensional force plate, with 2 forces measured: medial/lateral and vertical. As the initial weight transfer occurs laterally, anterior/posterior forces are disregarded.\nTo enable comparisons between subjects, the amplitude of each force signal is normalized for body mass, expressed as a percentage of body weight (%BW). The variability of forces during OLPS is analysed as the mean and standard deviation of these force signals during five intervals: 1) 0-0.49 sec; 2) 0.5-0.99 sec; 3) 1-4.99 sec; 4) 5-9.99 sec; 5) 10-15 sec (Jonsson et al., 2005). The test-retest reliability of OLPS has been reported to be 0.78 for vertical and 0.79 for lateral force variability (Rees et al., 2008).\nNote: In today’s lab, we will not be performing OLPS testing, due to the complex nature of the analysis.\n\n\n15-second Balance Assessment\nThis test involves shifting the body mass in an anterior/posterior plane, and examines the number of times an individual requires the use of the non-testing leg to regain balance. The subject commences standing with feet shoulder width apart and weight evenly distributed. They step forward approximately 30 cm and transfer their mass to one leg, and remain on one leg for as long as possible (up to a maximum of 15 sec). If the subject loses their balance, they are permitted to briefly touch down on the ground with their non-stance foot to regain postural control. The number of ground touches of the non-stance foot are counted and recorded. Further, the time elapsed until the first touch down is recorded, as this is noted as being significantly related to falls risk. The test is performed with eyes open in the first instance, and repeated with eyes closed (eyes closed condition is only undertaken by capable subjects).\n\n\nOther tests\nThere are many other functional tests to be found in the literature. You might come across the 6 minute walking test, tandem stand, the centre-of-pressure test, overhead reaching, Functional Movement Screen, ladder climb, tandem backwards walk, floor rise to standing, functional reach test, and many others. Research that examines their validity and reliability is abundant and there are many applications across a range of non-healthy clients.\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nIn small groups, conduct each of the tests and record your results below.\n\nActivity: Conducting Tests\n\nDynamic Tests\n\n\n\nTest\nTrial 1 (secs)\nTrial 2 (secs)\n\n\n\n\nSit-to-Stand\n\n\n\n\nTimed Up and Go\n\n\n\n\n10m Fast Walk (5-metre time)\n\n\n\n\n10m Fast Walk (10-metre time)\n\n\n\n\nStair Test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15-second Balance Tests\n\n\n\nTrial\nTrial 1 (Foot Touchdowns)\nTrial 2 (Foot Touchdowns)\n\n\n\n\nRight Foot, Eyes Open\n\n\n\n\nLeft Foot, Eyes Open\n\n\n\n\nRight Foot, Eyes Closed\n\n\n\n\nLeft Foot, Eyes Closed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircle/highlight the best trial result in each test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6km Walk Test\nIn the interest of time, you do not need to complete this test during the lab (typical duration 10-16 minutes).

    "text": "Lab Session - Part A\nQuestionnaires to Assess Functional Capacity, Barriers to Exercise, and Adherence to Exercise\n\nIntroduction\nExercise adherence is an important consideration in any program. There are many contributory elements to this complex issue, and while research continually builds around the topic, societal exercise habits about exercise participation are not improving. This tutorial content presents a range of questionnaires that provide non-physical methods to assess fitness, health and functional capacity along with some of the typically reported barriers to exercise.\nThe questionnaires are included for you to become familiar with by reading and completing them with the persona of an individual with a chronic condition. Please pick a range of symptoms that would typically be present in an individual with a cardiopulmonary, metabolic, musculoskeletal or neuromuscular condition.\nSome of these questionnaires might be appropriate for you to include as part of the testing battery for your assignment.\nPlease also see the Appendices of this lab manual for some additional questionnaires that are relevant for a number of chronic diseases.\n\n\n\nQuestionnaires\n\nGodin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (LTEQ)\nThe LTEQ is designed to quantify voluntary exercise participation and provide a guide to current activity levels.\n\n\n\nThe Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire\n\n\n\n\n\nScreening Questionnaire for Cardiovascular Risk\nThis link provides a simple online cardiovascular disease risk assessment tool developed by the Heart Foundation in association with the Australian Chronic Disease Prevention Alliance.\ncvdcheck.org.au\nThe site also provides useful guidelines and resources for health professionals and the general public.\n\n\nLab Question 1\nAre questionnaires such as this valuable to the general population?

A higher score indicates higher self-efficacy for exercise. The internal consistency has been reported as 0.92. When considering validity, the mental and physical health scores on the SF-12 questionnaire predicted efficacy expectations as measured by the SEE Scale. Furthermore, SEE efficacy expectations predicted exercise participation.\nHow confident are you right now that you could exercise three times per week for 20 minutes if:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Confident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery Confident\n\n\n\n\n1.

Naturally, it is important to concurrently report the participant’s compliance to the program to ensure that any changes were due to this intervention rather than any extraneous variables.\nParticipant compliance to a program may be calculated using a simple formula:\n\nCompliance = Number of sessions completed / Number of sessions available\n\nThere are several methods of assessing program compliance, however, the level of scrutiny depends on the required level of enquiry. Some researchers/practitioners only need information about the number of sessions that the client has performed, whereas others require more detailed information about session intensity, duration and rate of progression. In most circumstances, it is best to develop a questionnaire based on the needs of the client.\nAdditionally, the term ‘adherence’ better encapsulates a more holistic buy-in from the participant. An individual who adheres to the program has input to the weekly activities, is involved with setting goals, and tends to have a level of involvement that requires a qualitative set of measures to assess. Please consider the similarities between compliance and adherence when implementing the formula to compute either variable.\n\nLab Question 4\nList four possible methods to improve exercise adherence for a group of three friends - asthmatic, young adult females - who started an exercise program in a group as a new year’s resolution.

They meet at the local park on 4 mornings per week and perform a variety of ‘bootcamp’ style exercises under the watchful eye of a personal trainer.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican College of Sports Medicine (2017).

Whilst there are many confounding factors that contribute to these diseases, including genetics, dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease, sedentary behaviour is perhaps the primary cause of obesity and impaired insulin sensitivity. With the introduction of physical activity into daily life, individuals with metabolic diseases can significantly reduce the risk of mortality and improve their quality of life.\nPhysical activity is a proven method of achieving and maintaining a negative energy balance (to attain an ideal body mass). Monitoring physical activity is important in two main ways:\n\nPhysical activity measures are used diagnostically to assess current physical activity patterns.\nPhysical activity measures are used as a prescriptive tool, with a target distance to cover/number of steps per session being prescribed. In this way, the pedometer can also act as an incentive for participants to cover a set amount of work in a day.\n\nIt is common for practitioners to prescribe physical activity to clients with metabolic diseases, however, this activity must be prescribed on an individual basis. Current physical activity status, aerobic fitness, exertional distress and any injuries must be considered when prescribing an exercise program. For monitoring purposes, daily activity logs are often compiled by patients/clients, however, inaccurate responses are very common among patients with obesity and other metabolic diseases. Equipment such as pedometers, accelerometers and global positioning system (GPS) units provide objective measures of the amount of activity performed on any given day, and are accordingly far more reliable than other recording methods. \nThe objectives of this lab activity are to:\n\nGain experience using standard items to assess daily physical activity\nExamine the effectiveness of using physical activity monitors\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nEquipment\n\nGPS monitor\n2 x Pedometers (1 x basic unit; 1 x phone-based unit)\nMeasuring tape or trundle wheel\n\n\n\nPedometers\nPedometers are electronic devices that are used to measure the number of steps taken over a given time period. Usually worn at the hips, the quality of measurement varies between units, however, these counters can provide valuable information regarding movement patterns. Generally, pedometers are used to monitor or prescribe the number of steps for an individual, rather than directly attempting to quantify distance. However, there may be merit in attempting to obtain distance data from these units, as step length can be used to calculate distance.\nWhen considering daily step counts, the following guidelines represent different activity classes:\n\nFewer than 5,000 steps per day = sedentary\n5,000–7,499 = low active\n7,500–10,000 = somewhat active\n10,000–12,499 = active\n12,500+ steps per day = highly active\n\nDue to individual differences in metabolic rate and intensity of walking, it is difficult to calculate energy expenditure from number of steps taken per day. However, energy expenditure may be approximated from the data obtained, with a greater number of steps correlating with a greater energy expenditure.\nSome pedometers allow the entry of physical data such as height, body mass, or other characteristics to provide a more accurate estimate of energy expenditure. Whilst providing a guide to energy expenditure, these measures need to be treated with caution due to their lack of direct physiological measurement.\nA large scale research project incorporating physical activity prescription using pedometers is the 10,000 steps program based in Rockhampton, QLD. The project has attempted to increase physical activity in a regional town in an attempt to offset the growing obesity crisis. Participants are encouraged to wear a pedometer and undertake a minimum of 10,000 steps per day, through either incidental exercise during the day, or formal sport/exercise participation. In an attempt to maximise adherence, support is available to participants via phone calls and online resources. Researchers have determined that this quantity of physical activity (10,000 steps) approximates the guidelines for general health, although a greater number of steps per day is encouraged.\nFor more information about this program, go to 10000steps.org.au. In January 2025, they report that 685,547 members have logged a grand total of 432,606,819,172 steps! Similar gamification or reward models exist, for example Qantas Wellbeing.\nAccelerometers\nAccelerometers can provide a better measure of activity compared to pedometers as they can distinguish between walking, running, and even more explosive movements (e.g., jumping). Rather than a binary outcome offered by a pedometer (step or no step), accelerometers offer information about the magnitude/intensity of movement. Complex algorithms can also separate movement derived from skeletal muscle force output and movement generated outside the human capability, such as that recorded from riding in a car. Due to their precision and reliability, accelerometers are often used to validate pedometer step counts and are, therefore, a gold standard method for measuring physical activity.\nAccelerometers operate by measuring acceleration along a given axis. They are typically tri-axial (i.e., coronal, vertical, and anteroposterior), enabling measurement of movement in multiple planes (frontal, sagittal, and transverse). Mechanistically, the accelerometer sensor converts movements into electrical signals (counts) that are proportional to the muscular force responsible for producing motion (Melanson & Freedson, 1996). These counts are summed over a specified period of time and stored. This period is often 24 hours, or can be up to 2-3 full months depending on battery and storage capacity. Segmenting accelerometer data enables the determination of activity patterns which leads to deeper analyses, e.g., sleep vs awake time, and can provide information about temporal patterns of exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a review of this technology see Yang & Hsu (2010). A review of accelerometry-based wearable motion detectors for physical activity monitoring. Sensors, 10(8): 7772-7788. doi.org/10.3390/s100807772\n\n\n\nGPS monitors\nGPS (Global Positioning System) technology has revolutionised the way that exercise scientists are able to track athletes and research subjects. Small GPS chips are very affordable and user-friendly, with many different models available for &lt;$300. GPS units obtain position data from up to 31 currently-orbiting satellites that, with clear skies and an open area, can provide accurate location data to within 30 cm with modern mobile phones (typically closer to 5 m). Military and engineering applications can achieve sub-millimeter accuracy. Most GPS units measure position once per second (1 Hz), however some can log data at much higher frequencies, e.g., 5, 10, or 100 Hz, increasing accuracy (and file size).\nTogether with GPS data, most monitors also record heart rate to provide a more accurate measure of energy expenditure. This has obvious benefits for quantifying training loads and volumes. GPS monitors have been shown to accurately record distance and speed, however some factors can increase measurement error. Low measurement frequency can result in missed movements where faster movement patterns have greater error due to rapid changes in latitude/longitude. Additionally, the built and natural environment (buildings, trees, clouds) can also obstruct line-of-sight between the GPS unit and satellites. You may have noticed on your Strava map that the GPS trace sometimes goes wandering all over the road. This error can lead to overestimation of distance covered (about 5%). This represents a clear limitation of GPS-based tracking, which makes it unsuitable in some scenarios. Indoor positioning systems have been developed with very high accuracy (2 cm), which may make this less of a limitation (Serpiello et al., 2018; Spinney et al., 2015).\nWhen considering the use of GPS for tracking of humans, a pioneering article by Duncan et al. (2007) stated that:\n\nGPS measures position, distance, and speed based on the time taken to receive a signal from orbiting satellites; manufacturers report commercially available GPS to be accurate to within 15 m. High levels of precision were demonstrated by Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)-enabled Garmin GPS (Garmin Ltd., Olathe, KS) while the unit was stationary, with 99% of all points falling within 20 m of the actual location. GPS also recently has been used to assess a variety of human activities, making GPS an attractive alternative to self-report and other objective measures currently available to assess active transport travel distance, although this is largely unstudied. Previous research has demonstrated that physical activity can be assessed without substantial changes to behaviour attributable to the measurement process or measurement reactivity; therefore, GPS also may be used to assess active transport without bias introduced by measurement reactivity. Given the importance of distance as a barrier to active transport, it is imperative to gain accurate measures of distance travelled, to understand how the likelihood of active transport engagement varies by distance.\n\nDespite being more than a decade old, the paper highlights the potential use of GPS tracking when assessing daily physical activity. Participants are more likely to undertake their standard levels of movement as the devices are unobtrusive, and individuals may even develop a sense of forgetting that they are being monitored. Sensor technology improves each year, with high precision sensors being standard features in smart watches and phones. Common GPS units used in sport are from Catapult Sports (catapultsports.com) and Garmin (garmin.com).\nThe reliability of pedometers and GPS monitors have been published previously. In today’s lab session, we will be considering their accuracy relative to a criterion measure, with a view to considering their use in exercise prescription.\n\n\nProcedure\n\nSet up subject with GPS unit and 2 x pedometers.\nThe subject is required to perform the following:\n\n1 lap of the field at a slow walking speed\n1 lap of the field at a fast walking speed\n1 lap of the field running\n\nMeasure the number of steps from each of the pedometers and calculate approximate distance for each activity.

    "text": "Lab Session\n\nIntroduction\n12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG or EKG – German spelling is Electrokardiogram) are commonly used in clinical settings to screen for cardiac abnormalities, particularly electrical conduction defects, in both resting and exercise states. In today’s lab, you will learn the principles of using a 12-lead ECG at rest and during exercise.\nThe objectives of this lab are to:\n\nDemonstrate an ability to obtain a 12-lead ECG recording at rest\nDemonstrate an ability to obtain a 12-lead ECG recording during exercise\nUnderstand the various components of the waveform of an electrocardiogram at rest and during exercise\nDiscuss the accuracy and limitations of instrumentation in the interpretation of test results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this lab provides a valuable introduction to the use and interpretation of ECG, it does not qualify you in any way to use ECG for clinical practice or to provide clinical cardiology advice.\n\n\n\n\nCardiac Conduction\nA 12-lead ECG is the gold standard of cardiovascular assessment. A typical trace, with key segments and intervals labelled, is shown below. Each wave, including its magnitude, frequency, and shape can provide valuable diagnostic and prognostic information for cardiologists and qualified clinicians about an individual’s cardiac health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: ECG components - waves, intervals, and segments\n\n\n\nA typical resting ECG shows electrical cardiac events, which allow us to determine many different structural and contractile problems that might exist by comparison to a ‘normal’ profile. However, the mechanics of these assessments are quite intensive and require detailed reading to fully understand.\nIn the example of a normal adult ECG below, the top 3 rows display the 12 leads outputs (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, and V1-V6), while the lowest row(s) display an extended output for a selected channel - in this case, Lead I. The horizontal gridlines indicate the magnitude of electrical signal (10 mm/mV). The vertical gridlines indicate time, where each major grid is 0.2 seconds (i.e., 1 second = 5 grids).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: A normal adult 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG); a normal ECG diagnosis is made by excluding any recognisable abnormalities in each panel, which makes the description of observed responses quite lengthy\n\n\n\n\nPlacement of Electrodes\nWhen referring to ‘leads’ in an ECG reading, we are not referring to the cables attached to the patient, but to a combination of electrodes that form imaginary lines in the body along which the electrical signals, or the differences in electrical potential, are measured. In fact, when we set up a 12-lead ECG, we actually only require 10 electrodes and cables.\nThe first 6 leads (precordial; V1-V6) are unipolar and are measured directly from the 6 electrodes placed immediately around the heart at standardised positions on the chest. The remaining 4 electrodes provide bipolar (I, II, III) or augmented unipolar (aVF, aVL, aVR) limb leads. The positioning of the limb electrodes (RA, RL, LA, LL) depends on the nature of the test. For a resting ECG, these electrodes are placed on the frontal surface of each wrist and ankle. For an exercise ECG, each electrode is relocated proximally, with arm electrodes placed on the frontal aspect of each shoulder, inferior to the acromioclavicular joint, and leg electrodes placed on the oblique musculature, anterior and superior to the iliac crest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: 12-lead ECG electrode placement - note: limb leads may be modified depending on nature of test\n\n\n\nIn the ECG chart above, you will notice that the QRS complex is not always positive in the leads. Each lead reads (differences in) electrical activity in a specific axis and direction between two or more electrodes, which results in negative voltages in some leads reflecting the orientation of the electrical gradient being measured. Einthoven’s triangle describes the positive-negative electrical relationship (polarity) of the leads and how they produce their respective lead views.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEinthoven’s triangle demonstrating polarity between electrodes and origin of limb leads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLead formation during 12-lead ECG, including their polarity, plane, location, and view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLead\nType\nPlane\nLocation\nView of Heart\n\n\n\n\nI\nBipolar\nFrontal (Lateral)\nReads from Right Arm to Left Arm\nLateral wall of left ventricle\n\n\nII\nBipolar\nFrontal (Inferior)\nReads from Right Arm to Left Leg\nInferior wall of left ventricle\n\n\nIII\nBipolar\nFrontal (Inferior)\nReads from Left arm to Left Leg\nInferior wall of left ventricle\n\n\naVF\nAugmented Unipolar\nFrontal (Inferior)\nReads from heart centre to Left Leg\nInferior wall of left ventricle\n\n\naVL\nAugmented Unipolar\nFrontal (Lateral)\nReads from heart centre to Left Arm\nLateral wall of left ventricle\n\n\naVR\nAugmented Unipolar\nFrontal (Lateral)\nReads from heart centre to Right Arm\nBasal aspect of septum\n\n\nV1\nUnipolar\nHorizontal (Septal)\nFourth intercostal space, right of sternum\nVentricular septum (interventricular)\n\n\nV2\nUnipolar\nHorizontal (Septal)\nFourth intercostal space, left of sternum\nVentricular septum (interventricular)\n\n\nV3\nUnipolar\nHorizontal (Anterior)\nMidway between V2 and V4\nAnterior wall of left ventricle\n\n\nV4\nUnipolar\nHorizontal (Anterior)\n5th intercostal space on midclavicular line\nAnterior wall of left ventricle\n\n\nV5\nUnipolar\nHorizontal (Lateral)\n5th intercostal space midway between V4 and V6 (anterior axillary line)\nLateral wall of left ventricle\n\n\nV6\nUnipolar\nHorizontal (Lateral)\n5th intercostal space on midaxillary line\nLateral wall of left ventricle\n\n\n\nThe quality of ECG signals depends greatly on electrode placement on the patient. Body hair must be removed at each site to ensure good contact between skin and electrodes.\n\n\nThe Electrical Activity of a Sinus Rhythm\nIn order to conduct a 12-lead ECG it is important to understand the cardiac events that you are monitoring. Importantly, sections of the heart undergo depolarisation and repolarisation across the heart’s contraction cycle. Depolarisation is the process by which a resting cell becomes more positive and contracts, as an impulse from the sinus node is propagated. During this time, a muscle cell may go from its resting charge of -90 mV to a positive charge that may briefly reach +30 mV.\nRepolarisation is the process where a cell is returned to its resting electrical state. Repolarisation begins immediately after depolarisation, and after a plateau at 0 mV, the cell quickly returns to a charge of -90 mV. The plateau at 0mV allows a refractory period in which the cell cannot be depolarised again. Similar to muscle cells, both depolarisation and repolarisation are controlled by the sodium-potassium ATP pumps located within the cardiac tissue. An ECG measures these voltage changes at different locations and from different aspects of the heart.\nThe sinus rhythm displayed on an ECG trace replicates the depolarisation-repolarisation activity at different locations of the heart. Research has given an insight to the cardiac electrical events which are represented by different components of a sinus rhythm. The electrical events of the heart and the ECG components as represented by Lead I are shown in Figure 1B below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: A) Cardiac anatomy, including location and extent of critical nodes for electrical conduction across the heart; B) Heart contraction phases and the conduction pathways resulting in atrial and ventricular contraction, along with their reflection in electrocardiogram (ECG) trace (source: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology)\n\n\n\n\nThe first half of the P wave represents the SA node activation of the right atrium, and the signal reaching the AV node.\nAs the P wave is completed, both the left atrium and AV node have been activated. The peak of the P wave represents the activation of the AV node. P wave distortion may represent an abnormality in the morphology of either atrium. The P-R segment represents the electrical current reaching the Bundle of His and Purkinje fibres.\nThe first ventricle activation occurs in the intraventricular septum from left to right (hence the negative Q amplitude). AV conduction is measured throughout the PQ Interval (beginning of P wave to Q).\nThe activation of the two ventricles is represented as a tall positive spike (QRS complex). Note that despite the current flowing in both positive and negative directions the stronger current is flowing in a positive manner due to the larger thickness of the left ventricular wall. The polarity of the QRS complex may change depending upon which lead is being viewed. In leads I, II, and V3 to V6, the QRS complex is positive to neutral, whereas it may be positive, negative, or neutral in aVL or aVF. The aVR lead shows a negative QRS complex due to its orientation.\nThe repolarisation of the ventricles is represented within the ST segment and T wave. The point at which the QRS complex is complete and the ST segment begins is deemed the J point. Depression of the ST segment may be interpreted as problems in the depolarisation-repolarisation cycle within the ventricles. The T wave is the result of the rapid repolarisation of the ventricles. The T wave may be represented as positive in leads I, II and V2-V6. It also appears positive in aVL and aVF, but may be inverted if the previous QRS complex is less than 6 mm tall. The aVR lead shows an inverted T wave, whereas leads III and V1 show a varied polarity of the T wave. Whilst T wave changes may be the most sensitive measure of MI, it is also considered the least specific.\n\n\n\nR-R Interval, Heart Rate, and Heart Rate Variability\nThe R-R Interval - the time between two successive R-waves in the QRS complex - can be used to easily calculate the heart rate using the vertical grid lines shown on a typical ECG chart. By dividing 300 by the number of major (thick) grid lines that appear during each R-R Interval, we can quickly calculate instantaneous heart rate. The minor (thin) grid lines occur at increments of 0.2, so these can be included in the calculation if required. Alternatively, count the number of R-waves that occur in the ECG rhythm strip and multiply by 6 to give the average beats per minute.\nYour heart rate, even at rest, is not a perfectly constant rhytm. It fluctuates by fractions of a second with each beat in response to autonomic factors such as electrical impulse and breathing. This phenomenon is referred to as Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and is a completely normal and natural occurrence. HRV has been demonstrated to provide diagnostic value, for instance sinus arrythmia where HRV exceeds 0.12 seconds. HRV can be used to identify changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity that may indicate increased physiological or psychological stress, which may make it suitable for identifying your body’s responsiveness and resilience to stress at a point in time. Typically, higher HRV indicates higher adaptability, while lower HRV is observed with higher heart rates, which may be an indication of high stress or health problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nEquipment\n\nMetabolic Cart (MedGraphics CardiO2)\n12-Lead Electrocardiogram Module (Mortara)\nErgometer (treadmill or bike)\nElectrodes\nGloves\nRazors\nAlcohol swabs\nFine sandpaper\nAdhesive tape\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\nUsing the MedGraphics CardiO2 ECG Module\nIn today’s practical you will be using the MedGraphics CardiO2 ECG Module to perform a resting ECG. This is a clinical system which is used to perform diagnostic 12-lead ECG testing. The unit can record ECG results and search for trends and abnormalities in the data. In this manner, either electronic or manual identification of abnormalities is possible. Despite having sophisticated software to detect problems, manual checking to ensure accuracy of interpretation is recommended.\nElectrodes are placed as follows:\n\nSelect electrode sites over soft tissues or close to bone, using the Lab Manual or CardiO2 software for reference\nPrepare the electrode site by rubbing gently with fine sandpaper, then wipe with alcohol swabs to clean the site of any skin fragments, sweat, or oil; *If the patient has body hair at any electrode site, you must first remove the hair in the area using a shaver before following with sandpaper and alcohol swabs\nOnce the alcohol has dried, remove the adhesive cover from an electrode then apply the electrode firmly to the skin at each site, trying not to overlap the adhesive gel surfaces of the electrodes\nReferring to the Lab Manual or CardiO2 software, gently press each clip-on ECG cable onto its respective electrode, making sure to check that each clip is applied at the correct location and has been clipped on securely\nSecure each wire to the body using a small amount of tape in a position out of the way of moving limbs and place the ECG module in its holster or away from the client\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may be making physical contact with patients/peers’ bodies during this lab activity, so exercise professional conduct at all times - ask for consent before touching, and always explain what you are doing.\nFor female patients, electrodes must not be placed on top of the breast unless you cannot gain access to the normal electrode placement position. If you have to apply electrodes onto the breast, make a note on the recording. If you are required to shift the breast to correctly place the electrodes, use the back of your hand to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\nResting ECG Measurement\nOnce the patient details have been entered into the system and the electrodes have been correctly applied, a resting ECG can be recorded.\nA resting ECG will identify any resting cardiac abnormalities, and may pick up morphological changes such as ventricular hypertrophy. The system requires a high quality signal to determine any problems, so proper skin preparation is vital.\nThe subject is to be seated comfortably or lying down. In today’s lab we will have the patient lying down. The patient needs to be instructed to remain still for the entirety of the measurement with no talking, as limb or chest movement may result in movement artefact on the ECG trace. Ask the patient to cough and note what happens to the ECG trace.\nPerform a resting ECG on 3 students, and then analyse the printout in detail. You can refer to the sample traces of various conditions in the appendix for comparison.\n\n\nExercise ECG Measurement\nTo identify any cardiac abnormalities during increased work intensity, it is important to place the heart under cardiac stress. If any abnormalities exist, it is likely that they will become evident during maximal testing. However, maximal stress testing or a graded exercise test (GXT) should only be performed after extensive health screening, and a diagnostic need for the maximal test has been established.\nExercise ECG testing requires similar electrode placement as the resting ECG, with the exception that limb leads are always truncated for the duration of the test. Rather than sometimes being placed on the ankles and wrists (as evident in some resting protocols), the upper limb leads are placed immediately inferior to the distal 2/3 segment of the clavicle (avoiding the muscle mass) and the lower limb leads are placed on the oblique musculature, immediately superior to the anterior superior iliac spines.\nConstant monitoring of the ECG from the GXT should be performed for three reasons:\n\nTo ensure safety of the performer during GXT and training\nTo measure accurate heart rates\nTo diagnose cardiovascular disease\n\nThe first two objectives can be fulfilled by trained non-medical personnel, whereas the last is the responsibility of the supervising physician. Thus performing GXT is often a combination of exercise and medically trained professionals. However, both should be aware of the dangers of GXT and indications that the test should be terminated.\nWhen considering the formulation of an appropriate protocol for a test you will need to consider the activity level of the participant, the test duration, the rate of progression, and other factors. Some relevant information about ramping/non-ramping protocols, exercise modality, claudication pain, and specific examples of protocols are presented on page 67-69 of your textbook. Some example protocols are also included in the appendix for this lab class.\nIn today’s lab you will have one participant perform 2 x 3-minute stages of work on a bicycle ergometer, then 2 x 3-minute stages of work on a treadmill. This will showcase the typical fluctuations in ECG signal quality once exercise is introduced. The starting and subsequent-stage exercise intensities should be relevant to each participant’s level of fitness, but are not designed to be maximal (remember, the pre-screen tool only enables them to perform light-moderate intensity exercise if they are not already engaged in more than 150 minutes of exercise per week).\nRecord an example of the ECG trace for each stage and observe the difference from rest to exercise. This will form part of the discussion in class.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nRaw Measurements - usually made in frontal plane leads\n\nHeart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QRS axis in frontal plane\n\nRhythm Analysis\n\nState basic rhythm (e.g., “normal sinus rhythm”, “atrial fibrillation”); identify additional rhythm events if present\n\nConduction Analysis\n\n“Normal” conduction implies normal sino-atrial (SA), atrio-ventricular (AV), and intraventricular (IV) conduction; if abnormalities present, consider SA Block, AV Block?\n\nWaveform Description\n\nCarefully analyse the 12-lead ECG for abnormalities in each of the waveforms in the order in which they appear\nP-waves: are they too wide, too tall, look strange (e.g., are they ectopic?)\nQRS complexes: look for pathologic Q-waves, abnormal voltages\nST segments: look for abnormal ST elevation and/or depression\nT-waves: look for abnormally inverted T-waves\n\n\nThe ACSM has guidelines defining criteria for a quick and convenient assessment to determine if an ECG test is abnormal, and are listed below.

Naturally, it takes time to become an expert in ECG interpretation, however, exercise physiologists and clinicians are increasingly exposed to this information, so it is an important area of understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nWere any cardiac irregularities noted in the 12-lead ECG rhythm strip from the patient you tested at rest?

Clinical exercise physiologists are trained to observe abnormalities in ECG profile, with subtle differences in the PQRST waveform reflecting important cardiac deficiencies. A few typical abnormalities are described below, with some containing a sample abbreviated profile of the ECG trace for such conditions. For further information on such conditions, consult the reference list at the end of this lab.\nFor each of the following example ECG charts, try to calculate the heart rate by dividing 300 by the number of major gridlines between each R-wave peak (the minor gridlines are in 0.2 increments). Alternatively, count the number of R-wave peaks in the entire ECG strip (6 seconds) and multiply by 10 for the average beats per minute.\nA Normal Sinus Rhythm is shown here for comparison against the other conditions.\n\n\n\nNormal Sinus Rhythm\n\n\nSinus Arrhythmia: a normal ECG rhythm with a P wave, and between 50-100 bpm. The difference in RR interval duration between predominant beats is greater than 15%, and no premature atrial complexes are detected.\n\n\n\nSinus Arrhythmia\n\n\nSinus Bradycardia: a normal ECG rhythm with a P wave with a heart rate of less than 50 bpm.\n\n\n\nSinus Bradycardia\n\n\nSinus Tachycardia: a normal ECG rhythm with a P wave with a heart rate of greater than 100 bpm.\n\n\n\nSinus Tachycardia\n\n\nAtrial Fibrillation: an abnormal ECG rhythm with no P wave, and a heart rate ≤100bpm. The difference in at least one RR intervals between the predominant beats is &lt;15%.\n\n\n\nAtrial Fibrillation\n\n\nST Elevation: an abnormal ECG in which the ST elevation in leads V1-V6 is ≥1mV, and ST elevation in at least 2 of leads V1-V6.\nST Depression: an abnormal ECG in which the depression of the ST segment, and is best noted by 1mm depression for 0.06 sec in the lateral leads I, V4, V5, and V6. Exercise induced ST depression between 1-2mm reflect a moderate risk, however a greater risk is associated with &gt;2mm depression. ST depression is indicative of myocardial ischemia and blockage of a major coronary artery. An example of ST depression is given below (note leads I, V4, V5 and V6).\n\n\n\nST Depression\n\n\nEctopic beats: In some circumstances, the heart can undergo electrical conduction that is stimulated from outside the SA node. These irregularities are called ectopic beats. Ectopic beats are recognised by the abstract shapes produced within the ECG rhythm as they do not follow the normal conduction system of the heart. There are two basic types of ectopic beats: premature and escape. Premature ectopic beats are caused by irritable areas of the heart (commonly the atrium, AV junction or ventricles) that discharge before the signal from the SA node has been received. They are recognised by new waveforms/complexes that come early in the cardiac cycle (before next scheduled beat arrives). Escape ectopic beats arise from the same areas as the premature beats, and are considered a safety feature to prevent the heart going into complete arrest. They are often the end-product of the SA node failing to fire in a rhythm. The escape beats differ to the premature beats in the sense that they arrive late in the cardiac cycle, or preceded by a long pause.\n\n\n\nEctopic Beat - Premature Ventricular Contraction\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 2 - Common exercise protocols for cardiac stress testing\nThere are a number of different protocols used to perform cardiac stress testing, and the choice of which test may depend upon the nature of the patient visit, pre-existing orthopaedic or metabolic condition, or simply the technician’s personal choice.\nCommonly, stress tests are performed on either a treadmill or cycle ergometer due to their popularity, convenience, and safety. Stress tests are typically incremental in nature to provide the ability to monitor cardiac activity during lower intensity workloads prior to introducing greater workloads.\nImportantly, cardiac stress tests often maintain a low velocity, but rely on increases in either gradient or resistance to increase exercise intensity. These test modifications are necessary as the majority of patients requiring cardiac stress testing will be of low athletic ability and may risk either physical or cardiac injury by running at high speeds or cycling at a high cadence.\nThe introduction of performing stress tests through chemical stimulation as opposed to exercise methods may provide a safer manner of testing due to the lack of physical movement, however this is commonly reserved for patients who are at risk but are unable to perform substantial physical movement.\nListed below are a number of common protocols employed in cardiac stress testing for treadmill ergometers from chapter 5 of your textbook:\n\nBruce Protocol; the Modified Bruce Protocol skips the first two stages and has additional stages at higher speeds and grades\n\n\nStage\nDuration (min)\nSpeed (km·h-1)\nGrade (%)\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n2.7\n0\n\n\n2\n3\n2.7\n5\n\n\n3\n3\n2.7\n10\n\n\n4\n3\n4.0\n12\n\n\n5\n3\n5.4\n14\n\n\n6\n3\n6.7\n16\n\n\n7\n3\n8.0\n18\n\n\n8\n3\n8.8\n20\n\n\n\n\n\nBalke-Ware Protocol\n\n\nStage\nDuration (min)\nSpeed (km·h-1)\nGrade (%)\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n5.3\n2\n\n\n2\n1\n5.3\n3\n\n\n3\n1\n5.3\n4\n\n\n4\n1\n5.3\n5\n\n\n5\n1\n5.3\n6\n\n\n6\n1\n5.3\n7\n\n\n7\n1\n5.3\n8\n\n\n8\n1\n5.3\n9\n\n\n9\n1\n5.3\n10\n\n\n\n\n\nNaughton Protocol\n\n\nStage\nDuration (min)\nSpeed (km·h-1)\nGrade (%)\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n1.6\n0\n\n\n2\n2\n3.2\n0\n\n\n3\n2\n3.2\n3.5\n\n\n4\n2\n3.2\n7.0\n\n\n5\n2\n3.2\n10.5\n\n\n6\n2\n3.2\n14.0\n\n\n7\n2\n3.2\n17.5\n\n\n\n\n\nEllestad Protocol\n\n\nStage\nDuration (min)\nSpeed (km·h-1)\nGrade (%)\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n2.7\n10\n\n\n2\n3\n4.8\n10\n\n\n3\n3\n6.4\n10\n\n\n4\n3\n8.0\n10\n\n\n5\n3\n8.0\n10\n\n\n6\n3\n9.6\n10\n\n\n\n\nKeteyian, S. & Zuhl (2023), Graded Exercise Testing, in: Ehrman, J., K., Gordon, P.

Most cases of dyslipidemia are hyperlipidemia (high concentration of blood lipids), which refers to a sustained period of high serum lipid concentration. Such a condition can lead to many serious health complications.\nDyslipidemia is often the result of several lifestyle factors that relate to hypokinesia, and can manifest in a chronic condition (in particular, cardiovascular disease) which can dramatically affect risk of mortality and quality of life. Of each of the modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (including smoking, cholesterol, physical inactivity, hypertension, and diabetes) high levels of serum cholesterol appears to be the most critical factor.\nElevated concentration of low density lipoproteins (LDL-C) is directly related to an increased risk of coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases. An elevated LDL-C measure may lead to an increase in the development of atherosclerotic plaques in the arteries, thus affecting blood flow dynamics and central and peripheral blood pressures.\n\nLab Question 1\nWhat are some foods that are high in LDL-C?\n\n\nIn contrast to the negative effects of LDL-C, elevated concentration of high-density lipoproteins (HDL-C) is positively associated with cardiovascular health. In this way, it is ideal to have HDL-C scores as high as possible, and LDL-C scores as low as possible. There is a large body of literature stating the beneficial effects of HDL-C, as it acts as a scavenger molecule in the arterial network, assisting in the removal of atherosclerotic deposits.\n\n\nLab Question 2\nList some foods that are high in HDL-C and are therefore beneficial to include in a healthy diet.\n\n\n\nThe concentration of total cholesterol is directly proportional to mortality rate, and lifestyle and medical interventions have shown that these elevated values are reversible. With this in mind, it is important for patients with hypercholesterolemia and high LDL-C to modify their associated risk factors, in particular, diet and exercise.  \nThe measure of Triglycerides provides information pertaining to the level of circulating fatty acids. Elevated triglyceride levels are directly associated with atherosclerosis, therefore, attempts should be made to minimise the consumption of foods that contain high amounts of fat. It is common to witness elevated triglyceride concentration in conjunction with elevated LDL-C concentration. Triglyceride concentration is not as important as the LDL:HDL ratio, however, it remains an extremely important measure as far as cardiovascular health is concerned. The TC:HDL ratio is also an important marker of the type of cholesterol. Discuss whether a high or low TC:HDL ratio is preferred for optimal health…\nBlood chemistry is often assessed in a fasted state. This removes the acute nature of changes in certain hormones (especially insulin) which can affect blood chemistry and provides a more accurate representation of current health status. Each of the variables that you will be assessing today may be affected by pre-test diet. Triglyceride levels often remain relatively high for a sustained period after eating (6-8 hours) as food is digested.\n\nNormative Values for Blood Cholesterol and Triglycerides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nIdeal\nBorderline High\nHigh Risk\n\n\n\n\nTotal Cholesterol\n≤ 5.18 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)\n5.19-6.20 mmol/L (200-239 mg/dL)\n≥ 6.21 mmol/L (240 mg/dL)\n\n\nHDL Cholesterol (Note: Higher values are better)\n≥ 1.55 mmol/L (60 mg/dL)\n\n≤ 1.04 mmol/L (40 mg/dL)\n\n\nLDL Cholesterol\n≤ 2.59 mmol/L (100 mg/dL)\n2.60-4.20 mmol/L (100-160 mg/dL)\n≥ 4.21 mmol/L (160 mg/dL)\n\n\nTriglycerides\n≤ 1.70 mmol/L (150 mg/dL)\n1.71-2.25 mmol/L (150-200 mg/dL)\n≥ 2.26 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nEquipment\n\nCardiochek PA analyser\nPTS Lipid panel test strips\nBlood sampling equipment (gloves, alcohol wipes, lancets, gauze, tissues)\n\n\n\nProcedure\nWe will be using CardioChek PA analysers for the assessment of lipid profiles. You will divide into groups of 8-10 students, and within those groups, you will be placed in pairs and work as a team. One person will perform the testing, and one will play the role of the client.\nYou are required to treat the client with respect, as if they are a paying customer of a clinic, and obtain a brief background from them, including family history of hypercholesterolemia, heart disease/other conditions, recent exercise history, and any other pertinent information that may be relevant to this type of testing.\nThe subject will (ideally) be in a fasting state, having not consumed any food within the preceding 12 hours. Recent eating can dramatically alter blood cholesterol readings, rendering them a poor reflection of fasting values. Within your groups, preferably test only the individuals that have fasted to ensure good quality data.\nFollowing this testing, you will formulate a hypothetical patient and work through some issues.\nYou are required to assess the following:\n\nTotal cholesterol\nHDL cholesterol\nLDL cholesterol\nTriglycerides\nTC:HDL ratio\n\n\nBlood Sampling Technique\n\nSelect the puncture site (practice on either the fingertip or ear)\nWarm/hyperaemise the area with massage and/or Finalgon cream\nClean the site using an alcohol pad in a circular motion and allow to dry. Wipe site with a cotton pad.\nHold the site firmly and make the puncture in one continuous, deliberate, perpendicular motion. Punctures in the fingertip should be into the pulp and across rather than parallel to the fingerprint. Punctures in the earlobe should be in the flesh, avoiding any cartilage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the most important part of drawing a good blood sample. You need to make sure the puncture is performed with sufficient pressure or you may not be able to draw enough blood.\n\n\n\nWipe away the first drop of blood using a clean cotton pad or tissue, as it may be contaminated with other body fluids.\nApply moderate pressure to ensure adequate blood flow, but do not squeeze vigorously. This avoids collection of interstitial fluid in addition to blood.\nCollect the blood into the appropriate container, i.e., the capillary tube. Make sure you allow the blood to form a droplet first.\nIf further samples are required, or if the subject has to immediately return to exercise, cover the wound with surgical tape.  Otherwise, apply light pressure with a cotton pad or tissue until the bleeding stops, then cover with tape or band-aid.\nDispose of all contaminated material into the appropriate container.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce an item has been used it is considered contaminated whether blood is visible or not, and hence must be disposed of, or sterilised if intended for re-use. Equipment such as lancets and tissues must be used only once and then disposed of even when making repeated measurements on the same subject.\n\n\n\n\n\nCardioChek PA Technique\n\nSwitch the unit on with the arrow button on the right hand side\nEnsure the strip code you are using matches the code on the chip.\nSlide the strip into the unit, ensuring that it is oriented in the correct direction.\nAwait the instructions on the screen and then place the blood sample onto the strip. Make sure you cover the area fully, ensuring an even spread of blood. You need to be quick when placing blood onto the test strip as analysis commences automatically when the first drop of blood touches the strip.\nThe analyser will take a moment to produce the results. When analysing Cholesterol/Triglycerides, press the arrow button to scroll through the different results.\nRecord all results. Note: For some values, you may receive a score preceded by “&lt;” or “&gt;”, indicating that the score was less than or greater than the lower or upper limit for the testing device. Please make sure you pay attention to this when writing your scores down.\nOnce all results are recorded, remove the strip, clean the area as appropriate, and dispose of any materials used.\n\nSome of the values are directly measured, whereas the following calculation is used to indirectly assess LDL cholesterol:\n\nLDL = Total cholesterol – HDL – (Triglycerides / 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease be careful with the analysers and strips – they are expensive pieces of equipment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\nPatient Details\ne.g., name, age, health history\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\nTest Data\n\n\n\nVariable\nResult\n\n\n\n\nTotal Cholesterol\n\n\n\nTriglycerides\n\n\n\nHDL Cholesterol\n\n\n\nLDL Cholesterol\n\n\n\nTC:HDL Ratio\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nCase Study\nIn your pairs, generate pre-post test data for a hypothetical patient who presents with hyperlipidaemia and hypercholesterolaemia prior to completing an 8-week exercise program.

    "text": "Lab Session\n\nIntroduction\nWithin this tutorial you will learn how cardiac rehabilitation programs are implemented. Specifically, you will learn how to assess, screen and prescribe programs for patients with cardiovascular disease through case studies. There will be a discussion about various precautions and contraindications for exercise prescription for CVD.  Students will undertake a series of health screening protocols and discuss their relevance and importance to the safety aspects of clinical exercise physiology along with the need to work within the scope of practice.\nThe objectives of this lab are to:\n\nGain a detailed understanding of treatment strategies for cardiovascular conditions\nTo undertake screening exercises and appropriate questionnaires in the context of patients with cardiovascular disease\nTo consider the clinical aspects and logistical implications of implementing treatment for cardiovascular conditions\nTo develop safe and effective cardiac rehabilitation programs for a range of case studies\n\n\n\n\nActivity 1 - Cardiac Rehabilitation\n\nImportance of Cardiac Rehabilitation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Do Cardiac Rehab Programs Work?\nCardiac rehabilitation usually runs for 6 to 10 weeks. It often starts in hospital and continues when you go home. Programs can be implemented in different ways and places, for example:\n\nFace-to-face\nOver the telephone\nOn the internet\nIn a group or one-on-one\nIn hospitals, community centres or clinics\nIn your home\n\n\n\nCardiac Rehabilitation Process and Education\nThe following are the Heart Foundation’s essential steps in the cardiac rehabilitation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssential cardiac rehabilitation best practice statements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example brochure for a Sydney-based Cardiac Rehabilitation program is included below for you to gain an insight to the types of activities. We are fortunate to be able to gain detailed insight into such a program from the lead Exercise Physiologist in class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeart Foundation Recommendations for Initial Assessment Measures and Tools\n\nAll the major cardiac rehabilitation guidelines recommend that individualised assessments should be provided in the initial stages of a program and re-assessed prior to completion.\nCollaborative goal-setting and shared decision-making is essential to fostering self-care in a chronic disease population. This process should commence at the initial assessment and continue to be reviewed throughout the program.\nCardiac Rehabilitation involves a multidisciplinary team: rehabilitation specialists, cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, nursing, exercise physiologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, dieticians and social workers.\n\nThe Heart Foundation provides a large range of resources for practitioners which outline aspects of assessing patients, exercise prescription, healthy eating and psychological well-being.\nBelow are some examples from the Heart Foundation cardiac rehabilitation program content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn pairs, answer the following questions.\n\nLab Question 1\nList 2 essential components of a Cardiac Rehabilitation Initial Assessment:\n\n\n\n\nLab Question 2\nWhat are two clinical exercise capacity assessments you could apply in a CR setting?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity 2 - Screening, Lifestyle Risk Factors, and Risk Stratification\nThere are many different methods of screening individuals for medical conditions. Screening activities and questionnaires must be able to elucidate the issues associated with the ACSM table below. Typically, questionnaires aim to probe the patient/client to remembering any family history of illness or disease, any previous complications, and other conditions that may be present. Risk stratification is essential when working with individuals with chronic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Stratification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACSM Recommendation for physician/medical examination or supervision is needed to perform either moderate or vigorous exercise.\n\n\n\n\nScreening in the Australian Context: The Adult Pre-Exercise Screening System (APSS)\nThe APSS is accepted in Australia as the industry standard pre-exercise screening system as it is endorsed by the peak bodies of exercise in the country - Exercise and Sports Science Australia (ESSA), Sports Medicine Australia (SMA), and Fitness Australia.\nThere is a user guide to frame how each question should be approached and the screening tool consists of two stages. Both the user guide and screening tool are available at the ESSA website. It is also available in the Appendix for this lab.\nStage 1, which can be self-administered by the client, consists of six questions which are answered YES or NO, and are designed to identify individuals with signs or symptoms of underlying disease, or who may be at higher risk of an adverse event during exercise.\n\nIf the individual answers NO to all six questions, then the individual notes their exercise levels and is free to undertake light-moderate intensity exercise, but importantly, not high intensity exercise unless they are already undertaking &gt;150 minutes per week. Definitions of exercise intensities using a range of objective and subjective criteria are clearly specified in the APSS documentation.\nTicking YES to any Stage 1 question identifies the individual being at “higher risk”, which then requires a referral to an appropriately qualified allied health professional, such as AEP or a GP for additional guidance and assessment prior to undertaking exercise.\n\nStage 2 of the APSS is to be conducted by a qualified exercise professional and consists of additional questions on cardiac risk factors and medical history.\nWhen considering the Case Studies below, use the APSS as part of your screening process.\n\n\n\n\nActivity 3 - Exercise Precautions and Contraindications\n\nExercise Precautions and Monitoring\nWhen conducting exercise with patients with known and unknown low, moderate, or high risk of coronary heart disease you must always monitor exercise intensity and abnormal signs of symptoms, e.g., chest tightness/pain, dizziness, nausea. With resistance exercises it is important to avoid the Valsalva manoeuvre for all cardiac patients.\nYou will already be familiar with some common exercise monitoring methods. They may be objective or subjective measurement tools, and some are more accessible than others. Examples of these include:\n\nRPE (Borg Scale)\nBlood Pressure & Heart Rate\nTalk Test\nSelf Monitoring - always teach patient how to do this\nSymptoms (e.g., Angina Scale)\nMETs\nPulse Oximeter\nECG\nGeneral Observation\n\nMonitoring should be done before, during, and after sessions to ensure no adverse outcomes. It’s important to make sure the patient (and the person supervising) knows their limits.\n\n\nContraindications to Exercise\nIt’s important to be aware of and understand the contraindications to exercise - conditions that suggest we should avoid exercise.\n\nAbsolute Contraindications\n\nA recent significant change in the resting ECG suggesting significant ischemia, recent myocardial infarction (within 2 days) or other cardiac event\nUnstable coronary heart disease\nUncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise\nSevere symptomatic aortic stenosis\nUncontrolled symptomatic heart failure\nAcute pulmonary embolus\nAcute myocarditis or pericarditis\nSuspected or known dissecting aneurysm\nAcute infection\n\n\n\nRelative Contraindications\n\nLeft main coronary stenosis\nModerate valvular stenosis\nElectrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia)\nSystolic blood pressure at rest over 200 mmHg, diastolic over 120 mmHg\nTachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy or other forms of outflow tract obstruction\nNeuromuscular, musculoskeletal, or rheumatic disorders that are exacerbated by exercise\nHigh degree atrioventricular block\nVentricular aneurisym\nUncontrolled metabolic disease\n\n\n\nSternal Precautions Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)\n\nNo flexion/abduction past 90 degrees\nNo weight-bearing through the upper extremities\nNo lifting &gt;5-10 lb (max 4.5kg).\nNo unilateral reaching posteriorly\nSternal cracking/popping/clicking/clunking/pain could be sternal instability (***6-8 weeks for the sternum to heal***)\n\n\n\n\nCardiac Exercise Prescription\nBelow are some refresher examples of appropriate prescription for cardiac rehabilitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLab Question 3\nList 2 absolute and 2 relative contraindications to exercise\n\n\n\n\n\nLab Question 4\nWhat are two precautions for a patient 3 weeks post CABG?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity 4 - Case Studies\nFor the following case studies, work in pairs to perform a mock cardiac assessment. Nominate one assessor and one mock patient.\nScreen the patient, complete the sample cardiac assessment form, highlight any precautions, and create an exercise management plan (EMP) for the case study. The EMP should include short- and long-term SMART goals, a couple of exercise capacity assessments, and 4 weeks of exercise prescription with a 2-week progression.\nThe following are provided below and in the Appendix for this Lab to help you complete each case study:\n\nAn APSS form\nA Cardiac Assessment form\nAn Exercise Management Plan template\n\n\nCase Study 1\nCathy is a 62-year old female with Coronary Artery Disease.\nCathy attends your Cardiac Rehabilitation program 3 weeks post-operation for a double bypass. In her discharge summary from hospital you read the following findings: LDL 1.6 mmol/L; waist circumference 85 cm; resting BP 135/85; and, resting HR 65bpm. Medications on discharge: Atorvastatin (Lipitor – cholesterol lowering medication), Captopril (ACE inhibitor – BP lowering medication), and Sertraline (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors – Antidepressant). On another GP letter you find further information on her history of sedentary behaviour due to a busy corporate career as a lawyer and depression since her mother recently passed away from a heart attack.\n\nExercise Management Plan\nRisk Category:\nPrecautions/Monitoring Methods:\nPre and Post Exercise Capacity Assessments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Study 2\nLisa is a 76-year old female with hypertension and suspected Coronary Artery Disease.\nLisa attends a Cardiac Centre for a health and risk factor assessment. Her sedentary lifestyle had her concerned that the history of heart disease in her family might turn into something worrying. Assessment findings included: resting heart rate 84 bpm; blood pressure 172/68 mmHg; height 163 cm; weight 79 kg; waist-hip ratio 0.75; body fat (est. from skinfolds) 42%. Lipid profile included: total cholesterol 6.5 mmol/L; HDL 0.8 mmol/L; LDL 5.1 mmol/L; TC:HDL ratio 8.125; and, triglycerides 3.0 mmol/L. Fasting glucose was 7 mmol/L. Medical history included hypothyroidism, arthritis, insomnia, and a long-standing history of ankle edema. The patient also reported symptoms of sleep apnea.\nWhat would the cardiac risk factors entail for this patient and please provide a plan for improving health outcomes without relying upon medication in the first instance.\n\nExercise Management Plan\nRisk Category:\nPrecautions/Monitoring Methods:\nPre and Post Exercise Capacity Assessments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\nAppendix 1 - Adult Pre-Exercise Screening System\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 2 - Cardiac Assessment Form",

    "text": "Lab Session\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe topic and content covered in this lab session may cause discomfort or distress for some individuals in the class. Please be considerate of your peers and, if you are experiencing discomfort or distress during the lab, please feel free to let a tutor know and take time outside of the class - we are happy to talk at a time and place that is comfortable for you.\n\n\n\nMental illness is extremely common in Australia - 1 in 5 adults and 1 in 7 young people experience a mental health disorder in any year. These include anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, and contribute to the increased burden for the individual, their community, and the health system. Many people will live with mental illness for long periods, and it is often associated with co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes (Vancampfort et al., 2015). These contribute to the increase in disability adjusted life years (DALY) and life expectancy is ~15 years less than in those not living with mental illness (Lawrence et al., 2013).\nAs with any clinical population, there are important considerations to make when assessing, prescribing, and delivering exercise programs for individuals living with mental health disorders. The objectives of this lab are to:\n\nExplore the impact of mental ill-health on our well-being, including its effects on physical health\nExamine the evidence for exercise to support mental health and its potential to improve mental illness\nDevelop an understanding of exercise prescription considerations and physical activity interventions for mental health care settings\n\nTargeting modifiable risk factors, such as diet and smoking, are important steps to reducing the negative effects on cardiometabolic health. And. while the impacts of exercise on reducing cardiometabolic disease risk are well established, there is also growing recognition of the impact of physical activity on mental health and illness (Rosenbaum et al., 2014). Research indicates that physical activity interventions have positive effects on mental illness symptoms in individuals living with anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress, and substance used disorders (Csoznek et al., 2018). Benefits can include a reduction in symptoms experienced, and improvements in individuals’ engagement with mental healthcare services (Richardson et al., 2005).\nPhysical activity interventions can be impactful, safe, and cost-effective. However, there are challenge, including compliance, adherence, and reproducibility. It’s also important to note that exercise may not always be as effective as medication or therapy, and shouldn’t necessarily be a first choice for treatment (Fabiano, Puder & Stubbs, 2024). However, exercise should form part of an intervention plan, because it impacts mental, physical, and cardiometabolic health.\n\n\n\nImage: Exercise & Sport Science Australia\n\n\n\nLab Question 1\nYou may have noticed in the introduction and pre-lab readings that mental health and mental illness are intentionally differentiated. What do you think each of these terms mean and what do they encompass?\nMental Health is…\n\n\n\n\nand, Mental Illness is…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Life in Mind\n\n\n\n\n\nConsiderations for Physical Activity Interventions\nAs with any exercise program, practitioners should consider frequency, intensity, time (duration), and type (mode) of exercise. The Vella et al. (2023) paper in the Pre-Lab Activity provides a descriptive model for other contextual factors to consider in designing and implementing physical activity programs with mental health and well-being outcomes in mind. These additional contextual factors include:\n\nDomain - when and why you exercise, such as leisure-time or work-related PA\nPhysical Environment - where you exercise, such as green or blue prescription spaces\nSocial Environment - who you exercise with, especially with people who support the individual and make them feel valued\nDelivery - how it is delivered, including instructional styles that cater to an individual’s needs\n\n\n\n\nFrom Vella et al. (2023)\n\n\nThese contextual factors fit nicely within an evidence-based practice model, where a practitioner considers best available evidence, personal experience, and the preferences of the individual in their decision making.\n\n\n\n\nActivity 1 - Evidence Search\nIn this activity, you will work in your lab groups to conduct a brief evidence review of the effects of different types of exercise for a specific Mental Health Disorder. Your lab tutor will assign a case to your group and, at the end of the activity, your group will present a summary of your findings.\n\nUse Google Scholar, PubMed, or any other research database to identify relevant literature to help you collaboratively build an evidence table.\nYour evidence table should include findings relevant to the contextual factors discussed in the Vella et al., (2023) paper\nIn summarising findings for each type of exercise, consider the strengths, weaknesses, and potential barriers for them\n\n\n\n\nActivity 2 - Case Study\nIn this activity, you will work in your lab groups to design an exercise program for a Defence Forces Veteran living with Mental Health Disorders. The client has depressive symptoms, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including flashbacks, social avoidance, and night terrors.\nYou will use knowledge developed in Strength & Conditioning, Exercise Prescription, and Assessment, Prescription & Delivery to prescribe a holistic physical activity program. You will also need to make reference to the contextual factors discussed in the Vella et al., (2023) paper in designing your program.\n\nUse the SOAP notes structure to guide your assessment and planning\n\n\n\nDevelop specific questions that you would need to ask the client or other health professionals to gain the information you need to design an appropriate and effective program, e.g., collateral information, such as trauma responses and ‘catalysis for exacerbation’\nConsider potential “triggers” (and appropriateness of this terminology) for this individual\n\nThroughout the activity, the lab tutors will be roaming around to discuss your programs with your group prior to a lab debrief/discussion.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nFuture Learning Opportunities\n\nMental Health First Aid\nBeyond Blue\nBlack Dog\nESSA Professional Development Hub\nThe Mental Wellbeing College Podcast with Indi Dissanayake on Spotify, Apple, or YouTube\nMasters of Clinical Exercise Physiology\nResearch Projects with Dr Oscar Lederman\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nCzosnek, L., Lederman, O., Cormie, P., Zopf, E., Stubbs, B., & Rosenbaum, S.

It can affect anyone, regardless of age, ethnicity, or sex. Half of all Australian men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their life. The direct health system costs of cancer in Australia is more than $4.5 billion. The indirect costs, including the psychosocial and emotional stress it can cause is difficult to quantify.\nThe most common cancers in Australia are prostate, colorectal (bowel), breast, melanoma (skin), and lung cancer, accounting for &gt;60% of all diagnoses. The main carcinogenic factors are: environment (including behaviour), genetics, oncogenes, hormones, and impaired immune system function. Cancers typically form when one or more of these factors are present.\nMost of us have either experienced, or know someone close who has experienced, cancer in their lifetime. Untreated, cancers are typically fatal. But, there are treatments available for many forms of cancer, with many more being developed. Exercise can play a therapeutic role for cancer patients, and there is a growing body of clinical research on the benefits of exercise to counteract the negative effects of cancer and play an important role in its prevention, treatment, and survivorship.\nThe objectives of this lab are to:\n\nExamine the pathophysiology of cancer and its effects on patients’ health and well-being\nExplore the role of exercise in the prevention and treatment of cancer\nDevelop an understanding of exercise prescription considerations in cancer care settings\n\n\n\nImpacts of Exercise in Cancer Care\nThe following figure and table from the Hojman et al. (2018) article present an overview of known impacts and effectiveness of exercise in the prevention, treatment, and survivorship of cancer.\n\n\n\nFrom Hojman, et al. (2018).

    "text": "Lab Session\n\nIntroduction\nMedical and lifestyle advances have allowed us to live longer and enjoy greater quality of life as we age. As a result, nations’ populations of older adults has increased greatly; the number of Australians aged over 65 will more than double in the next 40 years (Intergenerational Report, 2023). That brings challenges that we must overcome.\nWhile our general health and well-being will be improved across our lifespan, there is no escaping the ageing process, which results in reduced functional capacity due to age-associated cardiovascular, respiratory, and musculoskeletal disease (among others). Many of these diseases are interactive and compounding. Ultimately, it can result in an inability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and, eventually, a loss of independence, becoming more reliant on others for care.\nBy now, we should all appreciate the incredible impact of exercise and physical activity on our health and well-being. We know it can improve our functional capacity, and that is true regardless of age. As such, exercise can play an important role in delaying the onset or degree of age-related disease, and maintain our independence and quality of life as we get older.\nAs with any clinical population, there are important considerations to make when assessing, prescribing, and delivering exercise programs for older individuals. The objectives of this lab are to:\n\nExplore the effects of ageing on our health and functional capacity, including typical age-related diseases\nExamine the evidence for exercise to support healthy ageing and improve quality of life\nDevelop an understanding of exercise prescription considerations in ageing populations\n\n\nAge-related Physiological Changes\nBetween the ages of 20 and 80, there is typically a 50% decrease in Maximal Aerobic Capacity. The factors contributing to this remarkable decrease in cardiorespiratory fitness include: decreased a-vO2 difference, heart rate, and cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance and end-diastolic volume, and decreased cardiac contractility and ejection fraction. Overall, these result in increased blood pressure, less cardiac efficiency, and less ability to supply oxygen to the working muscles.\n\n\n\nFrom Hojman, et al. (2018).

When prescribed and performed correctly, resistance training induces valuable acute and chronic responses and there are few (if any) individuals who should be advised against performing this type of training. However, safety is essential and will be a focus in this lab session.\nIn this activity, you will use and extend your knowledge and practical skills developed in Strength & Conditioning and Exercise Prescription to prescribe and deliver gym-based exercises that consider the needs and abilities of older patients. Your tutor will provide various examples of gym-based exercises for older patients, especially those with chronic disease. It’s your job in groups to make additional considerations that call upon your resistance training and coaching knowledge to develop appropriate training programming and exercises. This activity will take place in the Exercise Physiology Clinic (Level 2) and Resistance Training (Level 4) Gyms.\n\nIn your lab groups of 5-7 people, you will select 5 key lifts that you are familiar with, including one:\n\nUpper body free weight exercise,\nUpper body machine weight exercise,\nLower body free weight exercise, and\nLower body machine weight exercise\n\nFor each exercise chosen, have one person perform 10 reps as a young, healthy individual, while the group observes form and considers the key movement concepts\nAfter completing the set, spend 2-3 minutes as a group considering appropriate exercise modifications to allow an older adult (~75 years old) to complete the exercise safely\nHave 2-3 people perform 10 reps of your modified exercise while the rest of the group observes movement replication, safety, and suitability (i.e., for individual ability and to achieve tissue stress)\nOnce the set is complete, reflect on the modified exercise, including how the ‘patients’ felt performing the movement, and any further adjustments you would make\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity - Outdoor Exercise\nExercising outdoors can provide physical and mental health benefits for all ages. Many local governments are installing outdoor gyms as a health promotion investment to encourage physical activity and exercise among the community. However, these outdoor gyms may not consider the needs and abilities of older individuals, which poses safety risks and limits the effectiveness and health impact of these initiatives.\nIn this activity, you will work within your groups to design a ‘Seniors Park’ that includes various types of gym-like equipment to perform callisthenic type resistance training in an outdoor exercise space. Your design must consider older individuals’ functional abilities and needs to ensure users can safely perform activities that induce sufficient challenge physiologically and for motor control.\n\nConsider the layout, surfaces, equipment, and safety in your design\nDevelop some ideas for custom outdoor resistance training equipment that will enable specific joint movements for older individuals - make sure you include activities that provide upper- and lower-body challenges\nBe creative in the types of equipment you include, such as benches, beams, bars, and ropes\nIn pairs, write a description of one of your designed activities so that a new park user can understand what the exercise is, what muscles it uses, how to perform the activity safely, and what Activities of Daily Living it would be useful for\n\nOnce completed, work together in your groups to design an outdoor exercise circuit using basic fitness equipment provided in class\n\nCreate suitable and safe activities for use in an outdoor environment, e.g., at a park or beach, that make use of simple, cheap, and portable equipment\nConsider appropriate work and rest durations and intensities for older patients, and think about special safety considerations you will need to make, e.g., environment and equipment\nDiscuss appropriate progressions to make each exercise more challenging, physically and technically\nDiscuss additional equipment that may be useful for this context, or alternative types of exercise that could be considered\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThroughout the lab we will be viewing and discussing content related to exercise and healthy ageing.

    "text": "Lab Session\n\nIntroduction\nTo contract a muscle, your nervous system sends an electrical nerve impulse (action potential) to a motor unit, along motor neurons to the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) where a cascade of physiological events result in muscle contraction and relaxation (from sarcoplasmic reticulum release and re-uptake of calcium ions, respectively). In some individuals, this process may be impaired or inhibited due to local or possibly more global neuromuscular deficits or injury.\nElectrical muscle stimulation (or, electromyostimulation; EMS) therapy allows the generation of neural activity that can stimulate muscle activity via electrodes, either implanted or attached to skin. The electrical currents stimulate activation signals at the intramuscular axons (rather than directly in muscle fibres) in a manner that allows the downstream physiological events to occur, and work to be performed. Muscles cannot tell the difference between a voluntary contraction triggered by the brain, and an electrically-induced contraction.\nEMS may be used to either augment (make larger) or replicate the typical electrical signals your brain sends to motor units to generate muscle activity and force production. As such, it can provide a valuable adjunct stressor to induce physiological strain, resulting in adaptation. Such treatments can be beneficial for individuals with neuromuscular deficits, injuries, or pain, e.g., spinal cord injury, stroke, musculoskeletal strain or surgery. A major research focus of EMS has been musculoskeletal rehabilitation (e.g., muscle atrophy).\nIn this lab, we will be experimenting with Compex EMS devices, applying electrodes to various muscles to elicit muscular contractions. As with any training modality or tool, a practitioner should understand what it is, how it works, and why it is useful. Knowing what it feels like is a valuable experience so that you can properly explain to a client or patient what they will experience, and the potential benefits of it. This activity will help you to understand practical considerations when assessing the appropriateness before prescribing and implementing in practice. The objectives of this lab are to:\n\nExamine various clinical neuromuscular conditions and their impact on physiology and movement\nExplore the potential role and impact of EMS in rehabilitation and recovery\nConsider opportunities to use EMS in clinical, general, and athletic populations, and any ethical considerations that may be relevant\n\n\nElectromyostimulation\nEMS-based rehabilitation protocols typically involve electrodes applied to the skin adjacent to the target muscle and its nerve branches. The neuromuscular activation is limited by the electrical current applied and the transmission of signal through various tissues (skin, adipose, muscle). As such, the closer the electrodes are to the target muscle nerves, and the stronger the electrical current, the larger the impulse and muscle activation. Currents are conducted both across (transverse) and along (longitudinal) the target muscle, although the longitudinal distribution will be more effective as it remains superficial (i.e., less attenuation by tissue). It’s also clear that the positioning and orientation of electrodes is an important factor to maximise signal-to-activation effect. Some evidence logically suggests that the closer electrodes are to a motor unit, the more likely it is that action potentials will be able to propagate to every motor neuron and muscle fibre it innervates, maximising the effect of the stimulus on the target muscle.\n\n\n\nThe neural branch supply to three muscles, A) tibialis anterior by the deep fibular nerve, B) gastrocnemius by the tibial nerve, and C) soleus by the tibial nerve branching into superficial and deep compartments; from Enoka et al. (2019)\n\n\nA primary goal of EMS is to provide acute and/or chronic therapeutic effects. The effect that is achieved can depend on the type of electrical stimulation applied. Common variants include:\n\nNeuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) where high-intensity, intermittent electrical stimuli generate relatively large muscle contractions, it is commonly used for neuromuscular rehabilitation or strength training\nFunctional Electrical Stimulation (FES) where moderate-intensity, cyclical electrical stimuli generate functional movements similar to voluntary contractions, it is commonly used to restore lost function\nTranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) where low-intensity, continuous electrical stimuli are applied to cutaneous nerve fibres with little muscle contraction, it is commonly used for acute and chronic pain treatment\n\n\n\n\nCommon variants of peripheral electrical stimulation, from Carson & Buick (2021)\n\n\nFES and TENS have been successfully integrated into clinical rehabilitation settings (Maffiuletti et al., 2018). Evidence is growing for the use of NMES, and it has clear potential to be used in various populations and contexts, including maintenance (e.g., during disuse), restoration (e.g., after disuse), or improvement (e.g., athletic training) of neuromuscular function. The expected effects of NMES therapy are demonstrated in the figure below.\n\n\n\nExpected effects of NMES therapy (shaded area) for improving (healthy), maintaining (during disuse), or restoring (after disuse) neuromuscular function, from Maffiuletti et al. (2018)\n\n\n\n\nClinical Conditions\nStudies have shown that EMS can be beneficial for individuals affected by Spinal Cord Injury, Stroke, Brain Injury, Multiple Sclerosis, Cerebral Palsy, and Arthritis. The primary goals of this modality are to prevent atrophy or secondary disease resulting from lack of movement/physical activity, improve physical and mental well-being, and maintain local blood circulation and cardiopulmonary fitness.\nThe objective of EMS is not necessarily to induce movement from muscle contractions, in which case TENS may be the more appropriate modality, used to prevent or treat problems (i.e., secondary disease) associated with SCI or MS. These may include:\n\nDeep Vein Thrombosis (DVT; blood clots)\nPressure sores\nSpasticity (uncontrolled contractions)\nContractures (joint ROM impairment)\nTremor (involuntary shaking)\nOsteoporosis (loss of bone mineral density)\nAtrophy\nMale sexual dysfunction\n\nEMS has also been shown to be effective in preparation for and recovery from exercise (e.g., to complement a warm up or cool down protocol), injury and post-surgical rehabilitation, and to provide additional physiological stress during training.\n\n\n\nA study by Stevens-Lapsley et al. (2012) Physical Therapy demonstrates the potential benefit of NMES compared to control in rehabilitation from Total Knee Arthroplasty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nEquipment\n\nCompex Electrical Muscle Stimulator\nElectrodes\nGloves\nRazors\nAlcohol swabs\nFine sandpaper\nAdhesive tape\nMassage table\n\n\n\nProcedure\nWe will be using Compex EMS devices for neuromuscular stimulation. This activity involves guided discovery where, in groups of 6-8 students, you will experiment with location and orientation of electrodes to induce electrical stimulation of various muscles, making subjective assessments of contraction responses. You are allowed to perform the tests on multiple individuals within your group and, ideally, everyone should experience what EMS feels like (if you are comfortable doing so). As always, treat your ‘patient’ with respect and care.\n\nElectrode Placement\n\nHave the patient lie down or sit on the edge of a massage table to prepare for electrode placement; the patient may need to remove outer layers of clothing to enable easy access to electrode sites\nPrepare the electrode site by rubbing gently with fine sandpaper, then wipe with alcohol swabs to clean the site of any skin fragments, sweat, or oil; *If the patient has body hair at any electrode site, you must first remove the hair in the area using a shaver before following with sandpaper and alcohol swabs\nOnce the alcohol has dried, remove the adhesive cover from an electrode then apply the electrode firmly to the skin at each site, referring to the Compex Guide for locations and orientations, and trying not to overlap the adhesive gel surfaces of the electrodes\nReferring to the Compex Guide, press each clip-on cable onto its respective electrode, making sure to check that each clip is applied at the correct location and has been clipped on securely\nPlug the wires into the Compex device then switch the device on to select a program, referring to the Compex Guide to choose the appropriate program and intensities\nDuring the EMS bout, perform active and passive joint movements to assess contraction strength, and seek subjective feedback from the patient to support your observations\nAdjust electrode positioning if required before re-testing, or select a new target muscle and repeat steps above\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not throw out electrode pads - they are reusable\nDo not apply electrodes to the face, neck, near the heart or spine, or on genitals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nMake notes below about the target muscles chosen, positioning of electrodes, and the objective and subjective assessments made during your EMS trials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLab Question 1\nNow that you’ve had a chance to play around with the EMS devices, what considerations would you make before implementing this tool in practice?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLab Question 2\nThink about some creative ways that this tool could be used in clinical, general, or athletic populations - what settings would you be interested in researching to see if EMS can be useful for improving, maintaining, or restoring function?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThroughout the lab we will be viewing and discussing content related to muscle stimulation for neuromuscular rehabilitation.

The loss of BMC is often associated with ageing, postmenopausal hormone changes, secondary factors (e.g., immobility, medications), or a combination of these factors. Other metabolic factors can play a role, including vitamin (esp. Vit D) and mineral (esp. Calcium) deficiencies. In general, peak bone mass is achieved around the age of 30, after which bone mineral breakdown tends to exceed its formation. As such, maximising bone mass in the teens and early adulthood is valuable for maintaining bone health in your older age by delaying the onset of clinically-relevant osteoporosis.\n\n\n\nRelationship between age and bone mass for males and females, from Betts et al. (2013)\n\n\nDual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is a quick, valid, and reliable method for the measurement of bone mineral density (BMD). DXA is a valuable tool for the diagnosis of osteoporosis or low bone mass (osteopenia). Through one-off or longitudinal measurement of bone mineral content (BMC) and area at various sites with increased fracture risk, clinicians can calculate BMD and compare that to normative data to estimate differences to young and age-matched populations, and fracture risk. It can also assist clinicians in identifying rapid changes in bone mass that may be an indication of secondary bone loss or other metabolic factors. By identifying these changes early, clinicians can prescribe interventions (medications, exercise) that can help to halt the loss of bone mass before fracture.\nThe most common sites for DXA assessment of bone mineral content are the lumbar vertebrae (L1-L4, Antero-Posterior Spine) or hip (femoral neck and total proximal femur) as these sites encounter a large proportion of all vertical loading during activities of daily living and become more prone to fracture with low bone mass. The forearm forearm (radius) is less commonly used.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs per the WHO Classification, determination of low bone mass (osteopenia) is made when BMD Z-score is at least 2 standard deviations below the age-matched mean or the T-score is between -1 and -2.5 SD below the young adult mean, which indicates a possible secondary cause of accelerated bone loss. A determination of osteoporosis is made when the T-score ≤ -2.5 SD.\n\n\n\nAP Spine and Proximal Femur DXA Scans with Densitometry Reference Charts indicating patient’s BMD relative to young adult mean (T-score) and diagnosis thresholds\n\n\nDXA can also be used for total body composition scanning to measure lean and fat mass. This is a useful tool for assessing body composition in most populations, especially as a way to monitor longitudinal changes in response to lifestyle changes, e.g., diet and exercise. In the UTS Clinical Imaging Lab (Level 4, Moore Park) our accredited DXA technicians frequently perform body composition scans for elite athletes from sports clubs across Sydney. The lab also performs scans for the general public to assess bone and body composition for their own personal interest and health goals.\nThe first part of this lab provides background on DXA assessment for bone and body composition. We will cover principles of DXA measurement and interesting cases.\nThe second part of this lab will be a practical activity integrating your knowledge developed throughout the subject in prescribing and modifying exercises for individuals with various chronic clinical conditions. These are critical skills for Accredited Exercise Scientists and anyone wanting to pursue a career as an Accredited Exercise Physiologist.\nAs with any clinical population, there are important considerations to make when assessing, prescribing, and delivering exercise programs for clinical populations. The objectives of this lab are to:\n\nExamine the role of DXA for the determination of low bone mass - osteopenia and osteporosis\nDevelop an understanding of exercise prescription considerations for various clinical conditions\n\n\n\n\nActivity - Exercise & Chronic Disease\nThroughout this subject we have explored the clinical considerations for exercise prescription in individuals with chronic disease. This has included various assessments of functional capacity, and home- and gym-based training programming. In this lab, we will focus on planning and modifying exercise in a gym-based setting to provide physiological stress that is appropriate for the client and the clinical condition they are living with.\nYou will be presented with a series of case conditions that you will work through to prescribe and then modify exercises for the case individual. It’s your job in groups to make additional considerations that call upon your resistance training and coaching knowledge to develop appropriate training programming and exercises. This activity will take place in the Exercise Physiology Clinic (Level 2) and Resistance Training (Level 4) Gyms.\nYou will select 3-4 case conditions from the table below, and spend ~20 minutes working on each, following the instructions below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition\nPatient Considerations\n\n\n\n\nHypertension\nBP is 165/100\n\n\nMyocardial Infarction\n6 weeks post CABG Surgery\n\n\nHeart Failure\nReporting high level of fatigue\n\n\nPeripheral Vascular Disease\nLeg claudication upon exertion\n\n\nStroke\nRight side partial hemiparesis\n\n\nOsteoporosis\nAffected at the spine and has stooped posture\n\n\nRheumatoid Arthritis\nAffected at hand and wrist - unable to grip\n\n\nParkinsons Disease\nWrist and hand tremor and bradykinesia\n\n\nSpinal Cord Injury\nL2 Paraplegic\n\n\nCerebral Palsy\nFoot drop and sever wrist spasticity\n\n\nMultiple Sclerosis\nArm and hand tremor\n\n\nDiabetes\nType 2 peripheral neuropathy\n\n\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder\nExertional dyspnoea\n\n\nBreast Cancer\n8 weeks post-surgery - double mastectomy\n\n\nBone Cancer\nRecently completed 3rd round of chemotherapy and radiation therapy\n\n\n\n\nIn your lab groups of 5-7 people, you will select an exercise that you are familiar with and move to that equipment\nFor each exercise chosen, have two people perform 10 reps as a young, healthy individual, while the group observes form and considers the key movement concepts, target muscles, and safety considerations\nAfter completing the set, spend 5-10 minutes as a group considering appropriate exercise modifications to allow an individual with your case condition to complete the exercise safely, considering:\n\nSafe alternative exercises that target the same muscles\nChange in positioning or technique to minimise stress on affected body parts\nAppropriate progressions to make the exercise more technically or physically challenging if the patient finds it too easy\nAppropriate regressions to make the exercise less technically or physically challenging if the patient finds it too hard\n\nHave two people perform 10 reps of your modified exercise (assuming the role of the case patient) while the group provides coaching cues and assists/spots during completion of exercise, and observes movement replication, safety, and suitability (i.e., for individual ability and to achieve tissue stress)\nOnce the set is complete, reflect on the modified exercise, including how the ‘patients’ felt performing the movement, and any further adjustments you would make\nAll groups will briefly summarise and discuss their modifications with the class\nSelect a different case condition and modify the same exercise for the new case patient, repeating steps 3-6\nOnce you have completed step 7, move to a different gym equipment/exercise and repeat steps 2-7\n\nNotes\nExercise 1 ________________________________\nCase Condition 1 ________________________________\nCase Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Condition 2 ________________________________\nCase Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 ________________________________\nCase Condition 3 ________________________________\nCase Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Condition 4 ________________________________\nCase Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThroughout the lab we will be viewing and discussing content related to muscle stimulation for neuromuscular rehabilitation.
