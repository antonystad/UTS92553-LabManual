##### NHANES Scoring

The category score is the **worst** score the participant has for the questions in that category. For example,

-   Question 1: 1

-   Question 14: 2

Category score for Dressing (Q1, Q14) = **2**

Any score of 4, 5, or 6 automatically becomes a score of 3 for the category scores. For example,

-   Question 2: 4 >>> 3

-   Question 3: 1

Category score for Arise (Q2, Q3) = **3**

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
The Disability score is the average of the 8 categories, therefore the maximum disability score is 3
