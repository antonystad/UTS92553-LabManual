## Lab Session

### Introduction

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
The topic and content covered in this lab session may cause discomfort or distress for some individuals in the class. Please be considerate of your peers and, if you are experiencing discomfort or distress during the lab, please feel free to let a tutor know and take time outside of the class - we are happy to talk at a time and place that is comfortable for you.

Mental illness is extremely common in Australia - 1 in 5 adults and 1 in 7 young people experience a mental health disorder in any year. These include anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, and contribute to the increased burden for the individual, their community, and the health system. Many people will live with mental illness for long periods, and it is often associated with co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes (Vancampfort et al., 2015). These contribute to the increase in disability adjusted life years (DALY) and life expectancy is \~15 years less than in those not living with mental illness (Lawrence et al., 2013).

As with any clinical population, there are important considerations to make when assessing, prescribing, and delivering exercise programs for individuals living with mental health disorders. The objectives of this lab are to:

-   Explore the impact of mental ill-health on our well-being, including its effects on physical health

-   Examine the evidence for exercise to support mental health and its potential to improve mental illness

-   Develop an understanding of exercise prescription considerations and physical activity interventions for mental health care settings

Targeting modifiable risk factors, such as diet and smoking, are important steps to reducing the negative effects on cardiometabolic health. And. while the impacts of exercise on reducing cardiometabolic disease risk are well established, there is also growing recognition of the impact of physical activity on mental health and illness (Rosenbaum et al., 2014). Research indicates that physical activity interventions have positive effects on mental illness symptoms in individuals living with anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress, and substance used disorders (Csoznek et al., 2018). Benefits can include a reduction in symptoms experienced, and improvements in individuals' engagement with mental healthcare services (Richardson et al., 2005).

Physical activity interventions can be impactful, safe, and cost-effective. However, there are challenge, including compliance, adherence, and reproducibility. It's also important to note that exercise may not always be as effective as medication or therapy, and shouldn't necessarily be a first choice for treatment (Fabiano, Puder & Stubbs, 2024). However, exercise should almost always form part of an intervention plan because it has broad impacts for mental, physical, and cardiometabolic health.

#### Considerations for Physical Activity Interventions

As with any exercise program, practitioners should consider frequency, intensity, time (duration), and type (mode) of exercise. The Vella et al. (2023) paper in the Pre-Lab Activity provides a descriptive model for other contextual factors to consider in designing and implementing physical activity programs with mental health and well-being outcomes in mind. These additional contextual factors include:

-   Domain - when and why you exercise, such as leisure-time or work-related PA
-   Physical Environment - where you exercise, such as green or blue prescription spaces
-   Social Environment - who you exercise with, especially with people who support the individual and make them feel valued
-   Delivery - how it is delivered, including instructional styles that cater to an individual's needs

![From Vella et al. (2023)](images/Mental_vella.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

These contextual factors fit nicely within an evidence-based practice model, where a practitioner considers best available evidence, personal experience, and the preferences of the individual in their decision making.

### Activity 1 - Evidence Search

In this activity, you will work in your lab groups to conduct a brief evidence review of the effects of different types of exercise for a specific Mental Health Disorder. Your lab tutor will assign a case to your group and, at the end of the activity, your group will present a summary of your findings.

-   Use Google Scholar, PubMed, or any other research database to identify relevant literature to help you collaboratively build an evidence table.

-   Your evidence table should include findings relevant to the contextual factors discussed in the Vella et al., (2023) paper

-   In summarising findings for each type of exercise, consider the strengths, weaknesses, and potential barriers for them

### Activity 2 - Case Study

In this activity, you will work in your lab groups to design an exercise program for a Defence Forces Veteran living with Mental Health Disorders. The client has depressive symptoms, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including flashbacks, social avoidance, and night terrors.

You will use knowledge developed in *Strength & Conditioning*, *Exercise Prescription*, and *Assessment, Prescription & Delivery* to prescribe a holistic physical activity program. You will also need to make reference to the contextual factors discussed in the Vella et al., (2023) paper in designing your program.

-   Use the SOAP notes structure to guide your assessment and planning

-   Develop specific questions that you would need to ask the client or other health professionals to gain the information you need to design an appropriate and effective program, e.g., collateral information, such as trauma responses and 'catalysis for exacerbation'

-   Consider potential "triggers" (and appropriateness of this terminology) for this individual

Throughout the activity, the lab tutors will be roaming around to discuss your programs with your group prior to a lab debrief/discussion.

### Discussion

The terms "trigger warning" or "triggers" are often used to alert a person/group to something about to be presented or mentioned that may cause distress. Do you think the use of these terms is appropriate or even necessary? Why could they be beneficial or harmful?
